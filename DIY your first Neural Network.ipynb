    "**Artificial Intelligence** is a branch of Computer Science that studies and researches to develop **entities** -devices or machines- that have intelligence similar to a human being. Although there is not an official definition about what AI is. Some definitions draw the insights listed below. You can read more about the complexity behind trying to define what the human intelligence is, in the first chapter of [\"Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach\"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/intro.html) by [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) and [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell).\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other side, **Machine Learning** is a branch of AI. It allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Meanwhile, **Deep Learning** is an aspect of Machine Learning that is concerned with emulating the learning approach that human beings use to get certain types of knowledge. Deep Learning uses statistical models, which are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous system, and are so-called 'neurons', ['cartoon' versions of a biological neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdqu6fvjc5c).\n",
